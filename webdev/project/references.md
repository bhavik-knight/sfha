1. avoid [tab-nabbing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-html-to-open-link-in-new-tab/) while opening links in new tabs

2. [n-th child selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-child.asp) to hide some div on navbar while using media query for small screen

3. [flex-grow-strink](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-flex-grow-flex-shrink-and-flex-basis/) for responsiveness

4. jQuery [Form selectors](https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/form-selectors/) for switch, buttons, checkbox etc.

5. fix for [favicon.ico](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31075893/im-getting-favicon-ico-error/) error on browser console.

6. easiest fix for removing black border from button that are being clicked - if using `bootstrap .btn class` then in css using the class selector `.btn` add `border: 1px solid transparent`

7. create layers using [z-index](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_z-index.asp). Menu should be on top on image and other divs of the page.

8. fix navbar at top. Let assume that navbar height is 60px. `height: 60px`, `position: fixed`, `top: 0` and `overflow: hidden`. And in the next div/section `margin-top: 60px`.

9. [social media icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/facebook/) for the footer which are clickable buttons.

10. [Pseudo elements](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) for the extra styles. Like mouse hover over the buttons to change the color or highlight the border for that button, etc.
